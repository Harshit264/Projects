# Projects
This repository is the culmination of all the projects I have worked on as a developer. Many of them consist of passion projects. I will always be adding new projects to this repo as I create them. 

# How do you access the files?
Open the terminal and run the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Harshit264/Projects.git
```
This command will clone the repo on your computer. If you get any error regarding `git` not existing on your computer then you can download the `zip` file and extract it or download git on your computer using [this](https://git-scm.com/) link. Click [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) to see the Documentation for the installation of git.

# To run the files
If the website that you are trying to run contains a `packages.json` file then go to your terminal and run the command: 
```
npm i
```
This will download all the `dependencies` required to run the website. If you get an error regarding `npm` not existing on your computer then you won't be able to run all the features of the website. You can download node and npm using [this](https://nodejs.org/en) link. Click [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-windows/) to see the Documentation for the installation of node and npm.
